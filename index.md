# 🎮 [Carson Dunn] — Game Developer Portfolio

Game Developer from Delaware. I like to make all sorts of games and work either solo or with rather large teams. I'm a generalist in most solo work, but I do specialize in 3D art as a Technical Artist on larger teams. In development, I don't have too many preferences when it comes to 2D, 3D, art style, game engine or whatever- though I do prefer Godot in many circumstances to Unity, which I am also experienced in. I am also currently working for Dark Tonic on their game Blunderbusted, a gallery-shooter roguelike, as a technical artist. 
Below are my games, many of which were group work for University classes, game jams, or other sponsored projects. The higher ones are more recent, and I believe reflect my best work. Some standouts are as follows:
Kronos Manor, a point and click game developed for a 400-level Game Studio course with a team of nine where I was the lead programmer.
Summer Scholars, fittingly named as a tech demo for the University of Delaware Summer Scholars program completed in the summer of 2024. It focuses on 3D art and environments, specifically as a demo to show my many disciplines as of expected of Technical Artists. This includes rigging, animation, shader knowledge, toolmaking, and more. I did this one solo, and nearly everything in the project aside from the PBR textures were hand-made.
Lastly, Wooden Wars, a collaborative project done for a game jam in about a month. It's a genuinely enjoyable, polished product and some of my proudest work for not only the tight deadline, but also for having unique gameplay that feels notonly polished, but challenging. As a cooperative project, both my colleague and I shared essentially all of the work across disciplines on this game, functioning as programmers and artists. 

This website aims to have everything in one place, featuring playable games straight from here whenever possible.
